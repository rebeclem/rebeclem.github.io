To understand how these changes affect insect biodiversity, I used statistical computing in R to compare fly diversity (>17,000 flies from 132 sites) across a livestock grazing gradient. My analysis suggested that in heavily grazed areas, fly family diversity is lower than in lightly grazed areas. This disparity pointed to several families as grazing disturbance bioindicators.

2021-04-20	Assessing the Australian termite diversity anomaly: how habitat and rainfall affect termite assemblages.	Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution  Termites are important ecosystem engineers in tropical habitats, with different feeding groups able to decompose wood, grass, litter, and soil organic matter. In most tropical regions, termite abundance and species diversity are assumed to increase with rainfall, with highest levels found in rainforests. However, in the Australian tropics, this pattern is thought to be reversed, with lower species richness and termite abundance found in rainforest than drier habitats. The potential mechanisms underlying this pattern remain unclear. We compared termite assemblages (abundance, activity, diversity, and feeding group composition) across five sites along a precipitation gradient in tropical North Queensland.  Clement, R.A., H.

Here we present the first dated, species-level, multigene, molecular phylogeny for the group to test generic and species-limits, as well as the evolution of migration and range size.
