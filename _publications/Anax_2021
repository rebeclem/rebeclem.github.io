title: "Phylogeny , migration and geographic range size evolution of Anax dragonflies (Anisoptera: Aeshnidae)."
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Anax_2021
excerpt: 'The genus Anax is a group of cosmopolitan dragonflies noted for its conspicuous migratory behaviours and large size. Here we present the first dated, species-level, multigene, molecular phylogeny for the group to test generic and species-limits, as well as the evolution of migration and range size.'

The genus Anax is a group of cosmopolitan dragonflies noted for its conspicuous migratory behaviours and large size. Here we present the first dated, species-level, multigene, molecular phylogeny for the group to test generic and species-limits, as well as the evolution of migration and range size.
