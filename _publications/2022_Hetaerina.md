title: "Evolution and Biogeographic History of Rubyspot Damselflies
(Hetaerininae: Calopterygidae: Odonata)."
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022_Hetaerina
excerpt: 'Rubyspot damselflies are beautiful Calopterygids that often have red spots on their wings. Led by the brilliant Sam Standring with some top-notch collaborators, we built a phylogeny of this genus and its sister group Mnesarete. We found that the rubyspot was lost four times and that the ancestors of this group were forest-dwellers.'
