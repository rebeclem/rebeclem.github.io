title: "Insights Into the Resistome of Bovine Clinical Mastitis Microbiome, a Key Factor in Disease Complication."
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Hoque_2020
excerpt: 'Bovine clinical mastitis (CM) is one of the most prevalent diseases caused by a wide range of resident microbes. The emergence of antimicrobial resistance in CM bacteria is well-known, however, the genomic resistance composition (the resistome) at the microbiome-level is not well characterized. In this study, we applied whole metagenome sequencing (WMS) to characterize the resistome of the CM microbiome, focusing on antibiotics and metals resistance, biofilm formation (BF), and quorum sensing (QS) along with in vitro resistance assays of six selected pathogens isolated from the same CM samples.'
